\section{Lecture 2 - Introduction to P2P-Networks} % (fold)
\label{sec:lecture_2_introduction_to_p2p_networks}
Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networks lack a central server so that all entities are equal in the network.

\subsection{Features} % (fold)
\label{sub:features}
\begin{description}
	\item[Decentralized] \hfill \\
		No central server or component, all Peers are equal
	\item[Self-organized] \hfill \\
		Dynamic behavior of nodes, free to join, part, quit
	\item[Overlay Network] \hfill \\
		Leverages the Internet and uses a flat architecture
	\item[Large Scale resource] \hfill \\
		Heterogeneous network with large possible number of nodes
	\item[Collaboration] \hfill \\
		Based on voluntary participation with global reach
	\item[Flexible] \hfill \\
		Resilient to attacks and anonymous

\subsection{Problems with the Client/Server Model} % (fold)
\label{sub:problems_with_the_client_server_model}
The amount of Data the normal users transmit has been growing massively over last years.
Due to the increase in bandwidth,
users can also transmit these amounts of data.

\paragraph{Client/Server} % (fold)
\label{par:client_server}
is the classical model for the Internet.
A single server responds to the request of all users.
This server is also the problem of the model.
It may be easier to manage the single server,
but it is also the bottleneck and a single-point of failure.
If this server breaks down,
the service will not be available
and a single server just won't scale.

\paragraph{Replication} % (fold)
\label{par:replication}
solves some problems with the client/server model.
The server is mirrored so that it is not a single-point of failure anymore.
Although replication will still not scale well
and one can run into trouble due to high-workload on a single replica.
This single replica than has the same problems as a single server
as the workload is not distributed among the others.
Also maintenance might be a problem.

\paragraph{Proxy \& CDN} % (fold)
\label{par:proxy_&_cdn}
can circumvent the problems with balancing the workload,
but still do not scale well in terms of bandwidth and CPU power.
And as they increase the complexity,
they maintenance gets more difficult.

\subsection{Peer 2 Peer} % (fold)
\label{sub:peer_2_peer}
Peer-to-Peer has some advantages over the classical client/server-model.
These systems work even better if more users are connected.
They are designed to be easy to use and to deploy,
to be fault tolerant.
Users can connect and leave dynamically and the quality of service is not altered.

\paragraph{Current State}
of P2P networks is that their overall share of network bandwidth used is declining.
This is due to the fact that the overall amount of bandwidth used is increasing,
while P2P traffic is not increasing.

Topics in research are the structure of P2P Networks,
regarding structured and unstructured P2P.
The security and the privacy of the users are also a research topic,
as well as the legal issues associated with P2P
Locating the the desired data in the P2P networks has always been an interesting thing,
as different types of networks solve this in different ways.

\paragraph{Structured & Unstructured} % (fold)
\label{par:structured_unstructured}
are the main groups to sort P2P networks.
Unstructured networks are highly flexible,
dynamic and easy to maintain.
They base on the loosely connected nodes having no central point.
Due to this, it is hard to look information up.

Structured P2P networks have a fixed structure,
which enables an easy look up to find information.

\subsubsection{BitTorrent} % (fold)
\label{ssub:bittorrent}
BitTorrent is an unstructured P2P Network, that is very popular.
It accounted for 37\% of the Internet traffic in the German Internet in 2009.
The basic concepts of BitTorrent are \emph{chunking} and \emph{swarming}.
Where the files are split into smaller pieces or chunks,
so they can be downloaded in parallel and the order of download becomes irrelevant.
The chunks are then transfered between the nodes in a swarm,
who exchange the same content.

The basic components in a BitTorrent network are:
\begin{description}
	\item[Tracker] special server, tracking active peers and mapping file names to them
	\item[Peer] downloading as a leecher or sharing complete copy as seeder
	\item[.torrent] file containing the meta data of the data, ie. trackers IP and hashes of chunks
