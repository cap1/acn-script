\section{Lecture 2 - Introduction to P2P-Networks} % (fold)
\label{sec:lecture_2_introduction_to_p2p_networks}
Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networks lack a central server so that all entities are equal in the network.

\subsection{Features} % (fold)
\label{sub:features}
\begin{description}
	\item[Decentralized] \hfill \\
		No central server or component, all Peers are equal
	\item[Self-organized] \hfill \\
		Dynamic behavior of nodes, free to join, part, quit
	\item[Overlay Network] \hfill \\
		Leverages the Internet and uses a flat architecture
	\item[Large Scale resource] \hfill \\
		Heterogeneous network with large possible number of nodes
	\item[Collaboration] \hfill \\
		Based on voluntary participation with global reach
	\item[Flexible] \hfill \\
		Resilient to attacks and anonymous

\subsection{Problems with the Client/Server Model} % (fold)
\label{sub:problems_with_the_client_server_model}
The amount of Data the normal users transmit has been growing massively over last years.
Due to the increase in bandwidth,
users can also transmit these amounts of data.

\paragraph{Client/Server} % (fold)
\label{par:client_server}
is the classical model for the Internet.
A single server responds to the request of all users.
This server is also the problem of the model.
It may be easier to manage the single server,
but it is also the bottleneck and a single-point of failure.
If this server breaks down,
the service will not be available
and a single server just won't scale.

\paragraph{Replication} % (fold)
\label{par:replication}
solves some problems with the client/server model.
The server is mirrored so that it is not a single-point of failure anymore.
Although replication will still not scale well
and one can run into trouble due to high-workload on a single replica.
This single replica than has the same problems as a single server
as the workload is not distributed among the others.
Also maintenance might be a problem.

\paragraph{Proxy \& CDN} % (fold)
\label{par:proxy_&_cdn}
can circumvent the problems with balacing the workload,
but still do not scale well in terms of bandwidth and CPU power.
And as they increase the complexity,
they maintenance gets more difficutlt.
