\subsection{Introduction to OSN Scaling}
As Online Social Networks are extremly popular,
their demand for a scalable ifrastructure to support their grwoth is natural.
Cloud COmputing can provide such scaling,
but it leads to some problems that need to be deatl with.

Conventional scaling approaches are horizontal or vertical.
Where \emph{vertical} stands for the the upgrading the existing hardware.
This can be expensive and be techincally infeasible.
\emph{Horizontal} scaling means deploying a larger number of servers
and distributing the workload amongst them.
Although this is only suitable for stateless frontend servers,
on backend storage servers the data must be partitioned into disjoint components.

Bot approaches are not applicable to OSNs,
as the large amaout of data rules out vertical sacling 
and the large amount of interconnect makes horizontal scaling infeasible.
This refers to the fact that in an OSN,
ost operations are between users and their neighbors.
Their data is usually placed on multiple servers
and the mu 'multi-get' operations genrate a huge amount of traffic
and unpredictable responsetimes.

\subsection{Social Paritioning and Replication} % (fold)
\label{sub:social_paritioning_and_replication}
A novel soulution for these problmes could be \emph{SPAR} (Social Partitioning And Replication).
Its approach is to have a one-hop replication
so that all neighbors of users are replicated on the same server.
This leads to a 'Social Locality'.\\
The requirements for SPAR are:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Maintain local semantics
		\item Balance loads
		\item Be resilient to machine failures
		\item Be amenable to online operations
		\item Be stable
		\item Minimize the replication overhead
	\end{itemize}

\subsection{OSN in the Cloud} % (fold)
\label{sub:osn_in_the_cloud}
OSNs require features that can be delivered very well with cloud computing.
The networks need to be available in a reliable fashion
on a global scale.
They also require high amounts of flexibility in the amount of workload they can do.

Cloud computing can provide the availability, flexibility and scalability required by OSNs.
Due to the 'pay-as-you-go' plans the cost do not have to paid in front.
The cloud allows to serve customers,
but keep the cost at a low level.
Although the Quality of Service (QoS) must be maintained.
