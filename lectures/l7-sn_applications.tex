\subsection{Decentralized Search} % (fold)
\label{sub:decentralized_search}
The goal is to find the shortest path between a pair of nodes in a small world network.
As we have seen from Milgrams experiment,
a decentralized search where all nodes help is possible.

The principle is that node $s$ sending a message to node $t$,
without know the path to $t$.
Node $s$ only has local information
and does know the rough direction to node $t$.
It sends the message to a node it beliefs beeing closer to $t$.
The length of the searchpath is then the number of steps or hops till the message reaches $t$.

\subsubsection{General Network} % (fold)
\label{ssub:general_network}
	Depending on dimension it can either be a  ring or a grid.
	Each node is connected to its direct neighbors
	and has one long link.
	The probability of a link from $u$ to $v$ is then:
	
	\begin{equation}
		Pr\{u \rightarrow v\} ~ d(u, v)^{-q}
	\end{equation}
	Choosing the right value for the parameter $q$ depends on the network.
	It should not be too random and not to predictable.
	In experiements the ideal value is roughly at $1.75$.
