\section{Lecture 5 - Network Models} % (fold)
\label{sec:lecture_5_network_models}
As social networks play an important role on its inhabitants.
They influence the flow of information,
the spread of disease,
the trade of goods and services as well as which languages we speak and what we vote.\\
With network analysis technologies we can try to understand,
how their structure influences us
and which structures are likely to emerge in the society.

\paragraph{Marriage Network in Florentine} % (fold)
\label{par:marriage_network_in_florentine}
	An example can be the network of marriages in Florentine in the fifteenth century.
	Through network analysis one can find hints for the shift of power from the 
	Strozzi family to the Medici family.
	The Degree Centrality \ref{ssub:degree_centrality} for the Strozzi family in the network
	was only 4/15, but for the Medicis it was 6/15.
	The Betweenness Centrality of the Strozzis was $0.103$,
	which is very low compared to the $05.22$ of the Medicis,
	as more than half of the shortest paths between influential families went through the Medicis.
	This not only illustrates the importance of the families,
	but shows that knowledge about network structure gives insights into political and economic structures.

\subsection{Random Network} % (fold)
\label{sub:random_network}
There are several possibilities to create random networks.
We will discuss two variants here.

\subsubsection{Erd\"os-Renyi\\} % (fold)
\label{ssub:erdoes-renyi}
These networks are generated in a random process,
whom origins with fixed set of nodes $N = {1,2,..,n}$.
Then links between the nodes are added with a given probability $p (0 < p < 1)$.\\
For a given network with $m$ links,
the probability that it is formed is:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:erdoesrenyiprob}
	p^m (1 - p)^{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}-m}
\end{equation}
The Degree Distribution \ref{ssub:degree_distribution}
that any given node $i$ has exactly $d$ links is then

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:erdoesrenyidegreedist}
	Pr(d) = \binom{n-1}{d} p^d(1-p)^{n-1-d}
\end{equation}
For large $n$ and small $p$,
this binomial expression is approximated by a Poisson distribution

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:erdoesrenyipoisson}
	Pr(d) = \frac{e^{-(n-1)p}((n-1)p)^d}{d!}
\end{equation}
Such networks are called \emph{Poisson Random Networks}.
The connectivity of the graph can be calculated easily with Equation \ref{eq:erdoesrenyipoisson}.

\begin{equation}
	Pr(0) = e^{-(n-1)p}
\end{equation}
One can further solve this and when:

\begin{equation}
	(n-1)p= log (n)
\end{equation}
is larger than $p$ the graph will break in several components.
If $p > (n-1)p= log (n)$ the graph is connected with a high probability.
