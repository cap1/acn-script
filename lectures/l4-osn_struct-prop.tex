\section{Social Networks: Structure \& Properties} % (fold)
\label{sec:social_networks_structure_&_properties}

Networks can characterized in different ways.
Distinctive features are:\\
\begin{description}
	\item[Degree Distribution] How many Neighbors has a node?
	\item[Average Path Length] Whats the mean number of hops between nodes?
	\item[Network Diameter] How far apart are the nodes?
	\item[Distance - Shortest Path] How big is the network?
	\item[Clustering Coefficient] How close is a set of nodes connected with each other?
	\item[Community] Are subsets more closely connected?
\end{description}

	\subsubsection{Degree Distribution} % (fold)
	\label{ssub:degree_distribution}
	The degree distribution $P(k)$ describes the probability of randomly given node,
	having the degree $k$.
	It can be calculated as described in Equation \ref{eq:degree_distribution}.

	\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:degree_distribution}
		P(k) = N_k / N
	\end{equation}

	Where $N_k$ is the number of nodes.
